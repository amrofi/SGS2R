# SGS2R
R package which extracts data from the Central Bank of Brazil time series webservice (SGS - https://www3.bcb.gov.br/sgspub/) to R.

The present solution builds on a previous solution provided by Alexandre Rademaker, which was dependent on the SSOAP package and also received substancial contribution from Josaf‡ Rodrigues Carvalho Silva.

The solution made available here is of my own and do not reflect any corporative solution or public service made available by the  of the Central Bank of Brazil.
